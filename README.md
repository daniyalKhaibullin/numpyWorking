# NumpyWorking

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to improving my skills in NumPy through projects.

## Goals

- **Skill Enhancement:** Improving my proficiency in NumPy.
- **Project Development:** To gain a solid base in NumPy and Pandas for later projects.
- **Community Engagement:** Contribute to the NumPy community.

## Projects

- [Project 1: Matrix manipulation]: Write functions to perform basic matrix 
operations such as addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and transposition using NumPy arrays.
Implement functions for matrix inversion and determinant
calculation using NumPy's linear algebra functions (numpy.linalg.inv(), numpy.linalg.det()).
- [Project 2: Image processing]: Load an image into a NumPy array using a library like OpenCV or PIL. (don't have to use OpenCV or PIL)
Implement simple image processing operations such as grayscale conversion, 
resizing, rotation, and flipping using NumPy array manipulation techniques.

## Getting Started with NumPy

To get started with NumPy, you'll first need to install it. You can install NumPy via pip by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
If you prefer to install a specific version, you can do so using:

```bash
pip install numpy==<version_number>
```
For more detailed instructions, you can visit the [NumPy website](https://numpy.org/install/).

## Basic Usage

Once NumPy is installed, you can start using it in your Python projects. Here are some basic code snippets to get you started:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform arithmetic operations
arr_plus_one = arr + 1
arr_times_two = arr * 2

# Indexing and slicing
print(arr[0])        # Output: 1
print(arr[1:3])      # Output: [2 3]

# Reshaping arrays
arr_reshaped = arr.reshape(5, 1)

# Matrix operations
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix_inverse = np.linalg.inv(matrix)
```
For more information on NumPy and its functionalities, refer to the [NumPy documentation.](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/).
