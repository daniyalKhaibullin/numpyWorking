# NumpyWorking

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to improving my skills in NumPy through projects.

## Goals

- **Skill Enhancement:** Improving my proficiency in NumPy.
- **Project Development:** To gain a solid base in NumPy and Pandas for later projects.
- **Community Engagement:** Contribute to the NumPy community.

## Projects

- [Project 1: Matrix manipulation]: Write functions to perform basic matrix 
operations such as addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and transposition using NumPy arrays.
Implement functions for matrix inversion and determinant
calculation using NumPy's linear algebra functions (numpy.linalg.inv(), numpy.linalg.det()).
- [Project 2: Image processing]: Load an image into a NumPy array using a library like OpenCV or PIL. (don't have to use OpenCV or PIL)
Implement simple image processing operations such as grayscale conversion, 
resizing, rotation, and flipping using NumPy array manipulation techniques.
